# NASA API Portal React App

Welcome to my NASA API Portal React application! This project showcases my skills in front-end development by integrating with NASA's public APIs to display fascinating images from space.

## Overview

This project utilizes React functional components to create an engaging user interface. It consumes data from two different endpoints provided by NASA's APIs:

1. **Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD):** This endpoint fetches the stunning Astronomy Picture of the Day from NASA's collection.
2. **Mars Rover Photos:** Explore the latest images captured by NASA's Mars rovers, offering a glimpse into the Martian landscape.

## Features

- Display the Astronomy Picture of the Day along with its description.
- Browse through the latest images captured by Mars rovers.
- Click on any image to view it in full size and read its details.
- Smooth navigation and intuitive user interface.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, utilized for creating the frontend of this application.
- **NASA's Public APIs:** Accessing the Astronomy Picture of the Day and Mars Rover Photos endpoints to fetch space images.
- **Vercel:** The application is deployed using Vercel's platform, providing a seamless deployment experience.
